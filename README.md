Goal of the project:


I want to use a remote control to control a small car to move(2 cd motors inside the car). The car can move right, left, come and back. The rgb jumbo can repercent the function and request. 



Part lists and how to archive the goal:


1.infrared ir sensor and remote control

This sensor can get the signal from a remote control, I used this sensor to control the motor and the led.



2.H bridge:

H bridge is used as a connectionn  for the Dc motor. 


3.Dc  motor

2 small motors can connect to the arduino board, each one can control one wheel. I can use motors to let the car move.


4.RGB jumbo

RGB jumbo can show different types of color light.
